**Problem Statement**
RTC leadership often struggles with a huge volume of repetitive questions from students about different RTC procedures. At the same time, the RTC community often feels overwhelmed by long email chains and Facebook posts with updates on what the organization is doing and would benefit from a more centralized application that provides answers to specific questions they might have. There is room to automate this process so that leaders aren’t bogged down with menial questions and so that there is a single source of information for common questions that can get people instantaneous answers. On the backend, we could track common questions and make sure that the chat bot is updated with the most relevant information. A simpler scope project would have this learning be manual, a more complex project could use some AI in the background.

**Approach**
Create a chatbot on an external page to the RTC Wordpress website. The chatbot will be linked on the RTC website. The UI will be a full screen chat bot. Features will include buttons with common topics and questions for the user to choose from. The bot will display set answers to the chosen questions.

**Tools to be Used**
REACT with the MobX state management library, HTML, CSS

**Style guide will be adhered to while building the web application**
